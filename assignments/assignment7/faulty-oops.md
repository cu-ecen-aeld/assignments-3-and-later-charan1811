# Analysis of this kernel oops

## Brief

Analysis of the faulty device driver which is loaded into kernel using the command below to trigger "kernel oops" scenario.

## Loading the faulty driver

command `echo “hello_world” > /dev/faulty`. The faulty driver here tries to access NULL pointer.

## Kernel oops message
Output:

```bash
# echo “hello_world” > /dev/faulty
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

## Analysis:

* Error Description:
The error message indicates a kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000, resulting in a kernel panic.

* Memory Abort Info:
Provides additional information about the abort, including the exception syndrome register (ESR) and exception class (EC). The fault status code (FSC) indicates a level 1 translation fault.

* Data Abort Info:
Provides more details about the data abort, including the instruction specific syndrome (ISS) and information about the fault, such as whether it was a read or write fault.

* CPU and Process Information:
Specifies the CPU and process information at the time of the error, including the process ID (PID) and the name of the command that triggered the error (sh).

* Kernel Stack Trace:
Shows the kernel stack trace leading up to the error, including the function names and addresses. The faulty_write function from the faulty module is identified as the source of the error, along with other related functions such as vfs_write and syscall-related functions.

* Call Trace:
Provides a backtrace of function calls leading up to the error, helping to identify the sequence of function calls that led to the issue.

* Code Dump:
Displays a dump of the kernel code at the point of the error, which can provide additional context for debugging purposes.
